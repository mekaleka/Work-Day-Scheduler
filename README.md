This Day Planner saves user imputed data into the current hour of the day that the user is working in. It allows the user to manage their tasks and notes throughout their day and it also has color changing bars that alerts when thime is present, past or future. In order for this to happen I needed to create a function that saves documentation into locl storage when imputed into each bar. Loop through each hour block to show what block is the current, past or present time. Then display the current time. In addition to the html layout which included rows, collumns, id's and classes with styling from css I also used jQuery for the functionality. I used variables, functions, loops, if else and else if statements. I also used moment.js for storing the time and local storage for storing data.
